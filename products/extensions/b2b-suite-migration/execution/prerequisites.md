# Prerequisites

Before starting the migration, complete the following steps:

## **Backup Your Data**

::: warning
Always back up your B2B Suite data before initiating the migration. Even though the migration is designed to just add data to B2B Commercial and not remove any data from B2B Suite, having a backup ensures you can restore your data in case of any issues.
:::

## **Queue Worker**  

   Ensure the message queue worker is running to process migration tasks.
